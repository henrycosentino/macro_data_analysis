## Project Overview
- The purpose of this project is to explore two key economic variables: inflation and employment. And, how the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell sets policy considering those variables.

## Folders
- Inflation Report Reaction
    - The main notebook focuses on how the market reacts to an inflation report over one day
    - Findings
      - 2-Year Treasury Yield: Yield changes on CPI release days tend to be positive with higher-than-expected releases and negative with lower-than-expected releases
      - 10-Year Treasury Yield: Yield changes on CPI release days tend to be positive with higher-than-expected releases and negative with lower-than-expected releases
      - 2-Year CPI Swaps Yield: Yield changes on CPI release days tend to be positive with higher-than-expected releases and negative with lower-than-expected releases
      - 10-Year CPI Swaps Yield: Yield changes on CPI release days tend to be positive with higher-than-expected releases and negative with lower-than-expected releases
      - Generally, CPI swaps have a stronger relationship with both measurements of CPI Survey Delta than U.S. rates
