## Project Overview
- The purpose of this project is to explore two key economic variables: inflation and employment, and how the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell sets policy considering those variables.

## Folders
- Inflation Report Reaction
    - The [main notebook](https://github.com/henrycosentino/macro_data_analysis/blob/main/Inflation%20Report%20Reaction/cpi_data_analysis.ipynb) focuses on how the market reacts to an inflation report over one day
    - Findings
      - All Treasury yields and CPI swap yields show positive changes with higher-than-expected CPI releases and negative changes with lower-than-expected releases
      - CPI swaps demonstrate stronger correlations with CPI Survey Delta than U.S. Treasury rates
      - For most data series, as the spread of data increases, a stronger correlation is observed
- Jobs Report Reaction
  - The [main notebook](https://github.com/henrycosentino/macro_data_analysis/blob/main/Jobs%20Report%20Reaction/jobs_data_analysis.ipynb) focuses on how the market reacts to a jobs report over one day
  - Findings
    - 10-Year Treasury Yield: Daily yield changes for the sample period are normally distributed
    - 2-Year Treasury Yield: Yield changes on NFP release days tend to be positive with higher-than-expected releases and negative with lower-than-expected releases
    - 10-Year Treasury Yield: Yield changes on NFP release days tend to show no consistent relationship with higher-than-expected or lower-than-expected releases
- FED Dual Mandate
  - The [main notebook](https://github.com/henrycosentino/macro_data_analysis/blob/main/FED%20Dual%20Mandate/fed_analysis.ipynb) focuses on analyzing Jerome Powell's Federal Funds Rate decisions
  - Findings
    - Current FED policy relative to that of other FED chairs who made policy decisions under a similar economic regime to the current economic regime sets the policy rate moderately higher
    - Current FED policy relative to that of other FED chairs who made policy decisions under a lower inflation economic regime, compared to the current economic regime, sets the policy rate moderately higher
